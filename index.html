      <h3 class="bodyheader">The Bees Knees</h3>
      <p class="bodycopy">
        The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
        California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
        vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
        band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
        attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience working
        with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band
        could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to
        sign with a well known record label. From there, the band has soared,
        gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the
        Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band's
        original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
        hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
        affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their
        candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently
        recording their second studio album, looking to be released in early
        2024.
