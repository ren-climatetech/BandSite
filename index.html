    <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
    <p>
      The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
      California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
      vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
      band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
      attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience working
      with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band could
      succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign
      with a well known record label. From there, the band has soared, gaining
      international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts.
      New fans immediately fell in love with the band's original and organic
      attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and
      coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as
      “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on
      stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album,
      looking to be released in early 2024.
